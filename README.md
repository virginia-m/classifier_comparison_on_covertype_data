# Comparative classification accuracies on the covertype dataset

This repository contains the written report as well as full codes and notebooks on our work on classification of the forest covertype dataset. For more information, please have a look at the PDF report and then explore the notebooks.

We prepared this work for an assignment for the COMP5318 course - "Machine Learning and Data Mining" - taught at the University of Sydney, Australia by Fabio Ramos and Roman Marchant in the first semester of 2018.
