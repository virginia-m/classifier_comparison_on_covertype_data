MOTIVATION
-------------------------

... why is this dataset/type of prediction of interest?

[general intro of why people use machine learning for everything?]

Assessing natural resource information accurately is essential for land 
monitoring and managing purposes. Among typically recorded natural resources, the cover type of
forests is one of the most basic quantities [ref Blackard], and the precise determination of the
latter forms the basis for assessing floral and faunal development [ref ?].

Forest cover type data is routinely collected through either land-based personnel or
remotely sensed data, using for example satellite images [ref Landsat]. However, the feasibility
of these methods may be limited due to cost and time overhead, leading to the development of
predictive cover type estimation [ref Blackard] based on other geographical information that
exists for the area of interest.

- classification can also help with satellite imaging of forests with lots of different trees

- Blackard et al. assembled data set [...]

- classification can also help with identifying unusual developments, such as human interventions
or tree diseases...

- The publicly available covertype dataset has spurned many investigations into classification
algorithms and the relative simplicitly of the data makes it an ideal problem for machine learning
students.


- preprocessing:
    - look at how features relate to classes
    - add extra features, see how it affects classification
    - take fixed ratio of all classes for training
    
    - PCA
        - naive PCA, observe accuracy as function of number of components
        - Bayes PCA
    
    - remove outliers:
        - specific values
        - every value lower than 10%, and higher than 90% -> can play with percentages
            -> reducing data reduces accuracy - get about the same accuracy as with full data
               at 0.001 and 0.999.

    - feature engineering
        - soil family (instead of binary)? what if there is more than one soil type
          for one class?
        - wilderness area family (instead of binary) - does that actually help?               
               
- Random forest analysis
    - accuracy vs number of trees
    - max depth
    - max features
    - ... also learn about random forests. seriously.
